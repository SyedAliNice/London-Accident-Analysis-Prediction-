# London Accident Analysis Project
# Project Overview

This project analyzes road accident data in London boroughs using data mining techniques. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and key insights that can help improve road safety and inform policy decisions.
#   Files Included
1.  AccidentLondonBoroughs2223.csv – The dataset containing road accident records for different London boroughs.
2.  London Accident Analysis.ipynb & London Accident 
    Analysis_updated.ipynb – Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis, visualizations, and models.
3.  Course Work Specs and Marking Scheme.docx – Guidelines and grading criteria for the coursework
4.  data analyst codes.docx – Contains code snippets and data processing steps.
5.  requirements.docx – Defines the business problems and required analysis steps.
6.  Road-Accident-Safety-Data-Guide.xls – Documentation on dataset fields and meanings.

#   Business Problems and Data Mining Goals
1.  Accident Severity Prediction – Predicting the severity of an accident based on historical data.
2.  High-Risk Borough Identification – Identifying boroughs with high accident rates and their contributing factors.
3.  Temporal and Spatial Analysis – Analyzing accident trends over time and mapping high-risk locations.
#   Data Processing Steps
Data Loading & Preprocessing
1.  Handle missing values
2.  Convert data types (dates, categorical variables)
3.  Remove unnecessary columns
#   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1.  Statistical summaries
2.  Visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, geographic maps)
3.  Outlier detection
#   Feature Engineering
1.  Creating new features like Month, Hour
2.  Normalization and scaling
#   Machine Learning Models
1.  K-Means Clustering: Identify clusters of boroughs with similar accident patterns
2.  Decision Tree: Predict accident severity
3.  Neural Networks: Advanced prediction models
4.  Association Rule Mining: Find relationships between accident factors
#   Tools & Libraries Used
1.  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Folium)
2.  Jupyter Notebook
3.  Graphviz for Decision Tree visualization
#   How to Run the Analysis
1.  Install required Python packages (if not already installed): pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn folium graphviz
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook (London Accident Analysis_updated.ipynb).
3.  Run the cells sequentially to process and analyze the data.
4.  Review visualizations and model outputs to interpret findings.
#   Expected Outcomes
1.  Identification of high-risk boroughs and accident hotspots.
2.  Predictive models for accident severity.
3.  Insights into how time of day, location, and other factors influence accident occurrence.
